scoping breaks with let() inside functions (let vs local)

assignment to variables inside packages gets wrong namespace 
some vars could be global (we didn't know that) and assignment is made
to a Global var

- Do not search for different rotated PRDFTs, DFTs (search space doubles at least)

- Limit rule applicability for larger sizes,
  Implement a more general approach for common rule limits, like transform size

- Load(id) inside functions gives warnings

-----

- rlambda, clean implementation
- svct rules for GT
- test svct/libgen

- fPrecompute
- mincost libgen
