**
**  This file declares the functions of  MEMMGR,  the  GAP  storage  manager.
**
**  Memmgr is the  GAP storage manager.  That  means that the other parts  of
**  GAP  request  memory  areas  from Gasman.   These  are  then  filled with
**  information.  Gasman cares about the allocation of those memory areas and
**  the collection of unused areas.  Thus these operations are transparent to
**  the rest of GAP,  enabling the programmer to concentrate on his algorithm
**  instead of caring about memory allocation and deallocation.
**
**  The basic thing is  the bag.  This is simply  a continous area of  memory
**  containing any information, including references to other bags.  If a bag
**  contains  references to other bags these  references are collected at the
**  beginning of the bag.  A bag together  with all bags he references direct
**  or indirect, is called an object.  New bags are created with 'NewBag'.
**
**  When you  create  a bag using  'NewBag' this  functions returns  a unique
**  pointer identifying this bag, this  pointer is called  a handle and is of
**  type 'Bag'.  You  specify this handle  as  first argument to  every
**  storage manager function as first argument.  Variables containing handles
**  should begin with 'hd' to make the code more readable.
**
**  Every bag belongs to a certain type, specifying what information this bag
**  contains and how  bags of this type  are evaluated.  You specify the type
**  when creating the bag, you can retrieve it using the macro 'GET_TYPE_BAG'.
**
**  Every bag has a size, which is the size of the memory area in bytes.  You
**  specify this size when you create the bag, you can  change it later using
**  'Resize' and retrieve it later using the macro 'GET_SIZE_BAG'.

**
**  For  every type of bags  there is a symbolic  name defined for this type.
**  The types *must* be sorted in the following order:
**
**  Type of the non-printing object:       'T_VOID',
**  Types of objects that lie in a field:  'T_INT'      to  'T_FFE',
**  Types of objects that lie in a group:  'T_PERM'     to  'T_AGWORD',
**  Types of other unstructured objects:   'T_BOOL'     to  'T_FUNCINT',
**  Types of lists:                        'T_LIST'     to  'T_RANGE',
**  Type of records:                       'T_REC',
**  Extended types of lists (see list.c):  'T_MATRIX'   to  'T_LISTX'
**  Types related to variables:            'T_VAR'      to  'T_RECASS',
**  Types of binary operators:             'T_SUM'      to  'T_COMM',
**  Types of logical operators:            'T_NOT'      to  'T_IN',
**  Types of statements:                   'T_FUNCCALL' to  'T_RETURN',
**  Types of almost constants:             'T_MAKEPERM' to  'T_MAKEREC',
**  Remaining types, order not important:  'T_CYCLE'    to  'T_FREEBAG',
**  First non assigned type:               'T_ILLEGAL'.
**
**  The types of  changable objects must  lie  between 'T_LIST' and  'T_VAR'.
**  They are the types of objects that 'Copy' must really copy.
**
**  The  types of all constants,  i.e., the types of all  objects that can be
**  the result of 'EVAL' must lie between 'T_INT' and 'T_VAR'.  They  are the
**  indices into the dispatch tables of the binary operators.
**
**  The possible types are defined in the declaration part of this package as
**  follows (immutable types represent immediate values):
**
**  NOTE: values are assigned in the definition below to aid decyphering memory 
**  dumps during debug

**
**
**
**  This file declares  the functions of  Gasman,  the  GAP  storage manager.
**
**  {\Gasman} is a storage manager for applications written in C.  That means
**  that an application requests blocks  of storage from {\Gasman}, which are
**  called bags.   After using a bag   to store data,  the application simply
**  forgets the  bag,  and  we  say that  such a  block  is dead.   {\Gasman}
**  implements   an   automatic,  cooperating,   compacting,    generational,
**  conservative storage manager.  Automatic  means that the application only
**  allocates  bags,   but need  not  explicitly   deallocate them.   This is
**  important for large or  complex application, where explicit  deallocation
**  is difficult.  Cooperating means  that the allocation must cooperate with
**  {\Gasman}, i.e., must follow certain rules.  This information provided by
**  the   application makes  {\Gasman}   use  less  storage and   run faster.
**  Compacting  means that {\Gasman} always compacts  live bags such that the
**  free storage is  one large block.  Because  there is  no fragmentation of
**  the  free  storage   {\Gasman} uses   as   little storage   as  possible.
**  Generational  means  that {\Gasman}  usually assumes  that bags that have
**  been live for some  time are still live.  This   means that it can  avoid
**  most of the tests whether a bag is still live or already dead.  Only when
**  not enough storage can be reclaimed under this assumption does it perform
**  all the  tests.  Conservative means  that {\Gasman} may  keep bags longer
**  than necessary because   the  C compiler   does  not provide   sufficient
**  information to distinguish true references to bags from other values that
**  happen to  look like references.

*T  BagPtr_t  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . type of the identifier of a bag

**  bag identifier and no two live bags have the same identifier.  'BagPtr_t'
**  is the type of bag identifiers.
**
**  0 is a valid value of the type 'BagPtr_t', but is guaranteed not to be the

**  'NewBag4' returns the identifier of the newly allocated bag and the

**  which bag it should operate on (see "NewBag4", "TNUM_BAG", "GET_SIZE_BAG",
**  "PTR_BAG", "CHANGED_BAG", "RetypeBag", and "ResizeBag").
**
**  Note that the  identifier of a  bag is different from  the address of the
**  data area  of  the  bag.  This  address  may   change during  a   garbage
**  collection while the identifier of a bag never changes.
**
**  Bags  that contain references  to   other bags  must  always contain  the
**  identifiers of these other bags, never the addresses of the data areas of

*F  PTR_BAG(<bag>)  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  pointer to a bag
**
**  'PTR_BAG( <bag> )'
**
**  'PTR_BAG' returns the address of the data area of the bag with identifier
**  <bag>.  Using  this pointer the application  can then  read data from the
**  bag or write  data  into it.  The  pointer   is of  type pointer  to  bag
**  identifier, i.e., 'PTR_BAG(<bag>)[0]' is   the  identifier of the   first
**  subbag of the bag, etc.  If the bag contains  data in a different format,
**  the  application has  to  cast the pointer  returned  by 'PTR_BAG', e.g.,
**  '(long\*)PTR_BAG(<bag>)'.
**
**  Note  that the address  of the data area  of a  bag  may change  during a
**  garbage collection.  That is  the  value returned by 'PTR_BAG' may differ
**  between two calls, if 'NewBag4', 'ResizeBag', 'CollectBags', or any of the
**  application\'s functions  or macros that may   call   those functions, is
**  called in between (see "NewBag4", "ResizeBag", "CollectBags").
**
**  The first rule for using {\Gasman} is{\:} *The  application must not keep
**  any pointers to or into the data area of any  bag over calls to functions
**  that may cause a garbage collection.*
**
**  That means that the following code is incorrect{\:}
**
**      ptr = PTR_BAG( old );
**      new = NewBag4( typeNew, sizeNew );
**      *ptr = new;
**
**  because  the creation of  the new bag may  move the  old bag, causing the
**  pointer to  point  no longer to  the  data area of  the bag.   It must be
**  written as follows{\:}
**
**      new = NewBag4( typeNew, sizeNew );
**      ptr = PTR_BAG( old );
**      *ptr = new;
**
**  Note that even the following is incorrect{\:}
**
**      PTR_BAG(old)[0] = NewBag4( typeNew, sizeNew );
**
**  because a C compiler is free to compile it to  a sequence of instructions
**  equivalent to first example.  Thus whenever  the evaluation of a function
**  or  a macro  may cause a  garbage collection  there  must be   no call to
**  'PTR_BAG' in the same expression, except as argument  to this function or
**  macro.
**
**  Note that  after writing   a bag  identifier,  e.g.,  'new' in the  above
**  example, into the  data area of another  bag, 'old' in the above example,
**  the application  must inform {\Gasman}  that it  has changed  the bag, by
**  calling 'CHANGED_BAG(old)' in the above example (see "CHANGED_BAG").
**
**  Note that 'PTR_BAG' is a macro, so  do  not call it with  arguments  that
**  have sideeffects.

**
**  'CHANGED_BAG'  informs {\Gasman} that the bag   with identifier <bag> has
**  been changed by an assignment of another bag identifier.
**
**  The  second rule for using  {\Gasman} is{\:} *After  each assignment of a

**
**  Note that the  application need not inform {\Gasman}  if it changes a bag

**
**  For example to copy all entries from  one list into another the following

**
**      for ( i = 0; i < GET_SIZE_BAG-BAG(old)/sizeof(Bag); i++ )

**  'NewBag4( <type>, <size> )'
**
**  'NewBag4' allocates a new bag  of type <type> and  <size> bytes.  'NewBag4'
**  returns the  identifier  of the new  bag,  which must be  passed as first
**  argument to all other {\Gasman} functions.
**
**  <type> must be a value between 0 and 253.  The types 254 and 255
**  (T_RESIZE_FREE) are reserved for {\Gasman}.  The application can find the
**  type of a bag with 'TNUM_BAG' and change it with 'RetypeBag' (see
**  "TNUM_BAG" and "RetypeBag").
**
**  It is probably a good idea to define symbolic constants  for all types in
**  a  system wide   header  file,  e.g.,  'types.h', if   only  to avoid  to
**  accidently use the same value for two different types.
**
**  <size> is the size of the new bag in bytes and must be a value  between 0
**  and $2^{24}-1$.  The   application can find  the    size  of a   bag with
**  'GET_SIZE_BAG'    and  change   it  with  'ResizeBag'   (see   "GET_SIZE_BAG" and
**  "ResizeBag").
**
**  If the initialization flag <dirty> is 0, all entries of  the new bag will
**  be initialized to 0; otherwise the  entries  of the  new bag will contain
**  random values (see "InitBags").
**
**  What  happens if {\Gasman}  cannot  get  enough  storage  to perform   an
**  allocation     depends on  the  behavior    of   the allocation  function
**  <alloc-func>.  If <alloc-func>  returns 0  when it   cannot do a   needed
**  extension  of  the  workspace, then 'NewBag4'   may  return 0  to indicate

**  succeed.  So in  this case whenever 'NewBag4'  returns,  it succeeded, and
**  the application need  not check    the return  value of 'NewBag4'     (see
**  "InitBags").
**
**  Note that 'NewBag4'  will perform a garbage collection  if no free storage
**  is available.  During  the  garbage  collection the addresses of the data
**  areas of all bags may  change.  So you  must not keep any  pointers to or

**  detects that a list is sorted and contains  no duplicates, it changes the

**
**  'InitMarkFuncBags( <type>, <mark-func> )'
**
**  'InitMarkFuncBags' installs the function <mark-func>  as marking function
**  for bags  of  type <type>.   The  application  *must* install  a  marking
**  function for a  type before it allocates  any  bag  of  that type.  It is
**  probably best to install all marking functions before allocating any bag.
**
**  A marking function  is a function  that takes a  single  argument of type
**  'BagPtr_t' and returns nothing, i.e., has return type 'void'.  Such a function
**  must apply the  macro 'MARK_BAG' to each bag  identifier that  appears in
**  the bag (see below).
**
**  Those functions are applied during the garbage  collection to each marked
**  bag, i.e., bags  that are assumed to be  still live,  to also mark  their
**  subbags.  The ability to use the correct marking function is the only use
**  that {\Gasman} has for types.
**
**  'MARK_BAG( <bag> )'
**
**  'MARK_BAG' marks the <bag> as live so that it is  not thrown away during
**  a garbage collection.  'MARK_BAG' should only be called from the marking
**  functions installed with 'InitMarkFuncBags'.
**
**  'MARK_BAG' tests  if <bag> is  a valid identifier of a  bag  in the young
**  bags  area.  If it is not,  then 'MARK_BAG' does nothing,  so there is no
**  harm in  calling 'MARK_BAG' for  something   that is not actually  a  bag
**  identifier.
**
**  Note that 'MARK_BAG' is a macro, so do not call it with an argument that
**  has sideeffects.
**
**  'MarkBagWeakly( <bag> )'
**
**  'MarkBagWeakly' is an alternative to MARK_BAG, intended to be used by the
**  marking functions  of weak pointer objects.  A  bag which is  marked both
**  weakly and strongly  is treated as strongly marked.   A bag which is only
**  weakly marked will be recovered by garbage collection, but its identifier
**  remains, marked      in   a    way    which   can     be   detected    by
**  "IS_WEAK_DEAD_BAG". Which should  always be   checked before copying   or
**  using such an identifier.
**
**
**  {\Gasman} already provides the following marking functions.
**
**  'MarkNoSubBags( <bag> )'
**
**  'MarkNoSubBags'  is a marking function   for types whose  bags contain no
**  identifier of other   bags.  It does nothing,  as  its name implies,  and
**  simply returns.  For example   in  {\GAP} the  bags for   large  integers
**  contain only the digits and no identifiers of bags.
**
**  'MarkOneSubBags( <bag> )'
**
**  'MarkOneSubBags'  is  a  marking  function for types   whose bags contain
**  exactly one identifier of another bag as  the first entry.  It marks this
**  subbag and returns.  For example in {\GAP} bags for finite field elements
**  contain exactly one  bag  identifier  for the  finite field   the element
**  belongs to.
**
**  'MarkTwoSubBags( <bag> )'
**
**  'MarkTwoSubBags' is  a  marking function   for types  whose bags  contain
**  exactly two identifiers of other bags as  the first and second entry such
**  as the binary operations bags.  It marks those  subbags and returns.  For
**  example  in {\GAP}  bags for  rational   numbers contain exactly two  bag
**  identifiers for the numerator and the denominator.
**
**  'MarkAllSubBags( <bag> )'
**
**  'MarkAllSubBags'  is  the marking function  for  types whose bags contain
**  only identifier of other bags.  It marks every entry of such a bag.  Note
**  that 'MarkAllSubBags' assumes that  all  identifiers are at offsets  from
**  the    address of the    data area   of  <bag>   that  are divisible   by
**  'sizeof(Bag)'.  Note also that since   it does not do   any harm to  mark
**  something   which  is not    actually a   bag identifier  one   could use
**  'MarkAllSubBags' for all  types  as long as  the identifiers  in the data
**  area are  properly aligned as  explained above.  This  would however slow
**  down 'CollectBags'.  For example  in {\GAP} bags  for lists contain  only
**  bag identifiers for the elements  of the  list or 0   if an entry has  no
**  assigned value.

*F  InitBags(...) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . initialize Gasman
**
**  InitBags( <alloc-func>, <initial-size>,
**            <stack-func>, <stack-start>, <stack-align>,
**            <cache-size>, <dirty>, <abort-func> )
**
**  'InitBags'  initializes {\Gasman}.  It  must be called from a application
**  using {\Gasman} before any bags can be allocated.
**
**  <alloc-func> must  be the function that  {\Gasman}  uses to  allocate the
**  initial workspace and to extend the workspace.  It must accept two 'long'
**  arguments  <size> and <need>.   <size> is  the amount of  storage that it
**  must allocate, and <need>  indicates  whether {\Gasman} really needs  the
**  storage or only wants it to have a reasonable amount of free storage.
**
**  *Currently   this function must  return    immediately adjacent areas  on
**  subsequent  calls*.  So 'sbrk'  will  work on most  systems, but 'malloc'
**  will not.
**
**  If  <need> is 0,  <alloc-func> must  either  return  the  address of  the
**  extension to indicate success or return  0 if it  cannot or does not want
**  to extend the workspace.  If <need>  is 1, <alloc-func> must again return
**  the address of the extension to indicate success and can either  return 0
**  or abort if it cannot or does not  want  to  extend the workspace.   This
**  choice determines  whether  'NewBag4'  and  'ResizeBag' may  fail.  If  it
**  returns 0, then  'NewBag4' and  'ResizeBag' can fail.  If  it aborts, then
**  'NewBag4' and 'ResizeBag' can never fail (see "NewBag4" and "ResizeBag").
**
**  <size>  may also be   negative if {\Gasman} has   a large amount  of free
**  space, and wants to return  some of it  to the operating system.  In this
**  case <need>   will  always be  0.   <alloc-func>  can either  accept this
**  reduction of  the  workspace and return  a nonzero  value  and return the
**  storage to the operating system, or refuse this reduction and return 0.
**
**  <initial-size> must be the size of  the initial workspace that 'InitBags'
**  should allocate.  This   value is automatically rounded   up to the  next
**  multiple of 1/2 MByte by 'InitBags'.
**
**  <stack-func>  must be   a    function    that  applies  'MARK_BAG'   (see
**  "InitMarkFuncBags") to each possible bag identifier on the application\'s
**  stack, i.e., the stack where the applications local variables  are saved.
**  This should be a function of no  arguments  and return type 'void'.  This
**  function   is  called  from  'CollectBags'  to  mark   all bags  that are
**  accessible from  local variables.   There  is a generic function for this
**  purpose, which is called  when the application passes  0 as <stack-func>,
**  which will work all right on most machines, but *may* fail on some of the
**  more exotic machines.
**
**  If the application passes 0 as value for <stack-func>, <stack-start> must
**  be the start of the stack.   Note that the  start of the  stack is either
**  the bottom or the top of the stack, depending  on whether the stack grows
**  upward  or downward.  A  value that usually works is  the address  of the
**  argument  'argc'   of the  'main' function    of the  application,  i.e.,
**  '(BagPtr_t\*)\&argc'.  If  the application   provides  another   <stack-func>,
**  <stack-start> is ignored.
**
**  If the application passes 0 as value for <stack-func>, <stack-align> must
**  be  the alignment  of items  of  type 'BagPtr_t' on the  stack.   It must be a
**  divisor of 'sizeof(BagPtr_t)'.  The addresses of  all identifiers on the stack
**  must be a multiple  of <stack-align>.  So if  it is 1, identifiers may be
**  anywhere on the stack, and  if it is  'sizeof(BagPtr_t)', identifiers may only
**  be at addresses that are a multiple of 'sizeof(BagPtr_t)'.  This value depends
**  on  the   machine,  the  operating system,   and   the compiler.   If the
**  application provides another <stack-func>, <stack-align> is ignored.
**
**  <cache-size>  informs {\Gasman} whether  the  processor has a usable data
**  cache and how large it is  measured in bytes.   If the application passes
**  0, {\Gasman} assumes that the processor has no data cache or a data cache
**  to small to be   useful.  In this case  the  entire free storage is  made
**  available for allocations after garbage  collections.  If the application
**  passes a  nonzero value, {\Gasman}  assumes that this is  the size of the
**  part of the data cache that should  be used for  the allocation area, and
**  tries  to keep the allocation  area small enough  so that it fits.  For a
**  processor that has separate  data and instruction caches, the application
**  should pass the size of the data cache minus 65536.  For a processor with
**  a  unified cache,  the application  should  pass the size  of the unified
**  cache minus   131072.  The application probably should   not pass a value
**  less than 131072.
**
**  The initialization  flag  <dirty> determines  whether  bags allocated  by
**  'NewBag4' are initialized to contain only 0 or not.   If <dirty> is 0, the
**  bags are  initialized to  contain only 0.    If  <dirty> is  1, the  bags
**  initially contain  random values.  Note that {\Gasman}  will be  a little
**  bit faster if bags need not be initialized.
**
**  <abort-func> should be a function that {\Gasman} should call in case that
**  something goes  wrong, e.g.,     if it  cannot allocation    the  initial
**  workspace.  <abort-func> should be a function of one string argument, and
**  it  might want to display this   message before aborting the application.
**  This function should never return.
